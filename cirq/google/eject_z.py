    """Removes Z gates by pushing them later and later until they merge.

    As Z gates are removed from the circuit, 'lost phase' builds up. As lost
    phase is pushed rightward, it modifies phaseable operations along the way.
    Eventually the lost phase is discharged into a 'drain'. Only Z gates
    without a parameter dependence are removed.

    There are three kinds of drains:
    - Measurement gates, which absorb phase by discarding it.
    - Parameterized Z gates, which absorb phase into their turns attribute.
    - The end of the circuit, which absorbs phase into a new Z gate.
