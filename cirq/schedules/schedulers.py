    This method attempts to create a schedule in which each moment of a circuit
    is scheduled starting at the same time. Given the constraints of the
    given device, such a schedule may not be possible, in this case the
    the method will raise a ValueError with a description of the conflict.

    The schedule that is produced will take each moments and schedule the
    operations in this moment in a time slice of length equal to the maximum
    time of an operation in the moment.

    Returns:
        A Schedule for the circuit.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if the scheduling cannot be done.
