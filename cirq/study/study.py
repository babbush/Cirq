"""Defines studies and related classes.

Studies can be used to run repeated trials against different program
paramters and number of repetitions.

Example use:
    sim = Simulator()
    circuit = my_circuit()

    study = ExecutorStudy(executor=sim, program=circuit, repetitions=10)
    all_trials = study.run_study()
    # all_trials is a list of 10 (context, result) where context contains
    # the reptition id, and result contains the program's results.
