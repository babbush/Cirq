# This script fetches a pull request from the quantumlib/cirq repository and
# runs pylint on it. It informs github of the outcome of the linting via the
# 'pylint (manual)' status indicator.
#
#   bash pylint-pull-request.sh [pull_request_number] [access_token]
#
# The pull request number argument is optional, and determines which PR is
# fetched from the cirq repo to test. If no pull request number is given, the
# tests run against local files; the current repo state.
#
# The access_token argument is optional. If it is set to a github access token
# with permission to update status values on the cirq repo, then the status of
# the tests will be reported to github and shown within the PR. If not set, the
# tests merely run locally. If this arugment is not set, the script will fall
# back to the CIRQ_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable (if present).
#
# Requires that virtualenv has been installed.
